# Final idea selected:
## Live Video lecture with moderator.
### Reason:
we find this more agile and suitable to our given scenario of hybird classroom because with this we can easily switch between foll blown obline class to student onsite-teacher online or dividing student into online and onsite.We add the benefits of third idea as well in future with the help of recorded lectures of past years.
