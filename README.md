First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Muhammad Saad Haleem. I am a higher education student at PAF-KIET. My strength is I am self-motivated. My passion for helping others has been evident, by helping the people I have learned to interact with deserving groups of people, which has increased my ability to relate to others.
